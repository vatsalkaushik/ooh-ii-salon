## What is a civilization?

Civilization is not merely a collection of buildings or technologies, but an active, living process of social ordering that enables cultural creation. It is not a permanent state but rather a delicate achievement that must be continuously maintained and transmitted to each new generation.

> "Civilization is social order promoting cultural creation. Four elements constitute it: economic provision, political organization, moral traditions, and the pursuit of knowledge and the arts. It begins where chaos and insecurity end. For when fear is overcome, curiosity and constructiveness are free, and man passes by natural impulse towards the understanding and embellishment of life."

These four core elements—economic provision, political organization, moral traditions, and pursuit of knowledge/arts—are interdependent rather than hierarchical. Each supports the others in a complex web of relationships. The emphasis on "social order promoting cultural creation" suggests that mere social organization isn't enough; it must actively foster creative and cultural development.

## Technological and Economic Developments

### Early Technological Innovations

Humans created the first technologies by learning from nature. Food preservation and storage techniques were likely inspired by observing animals like squirrels, bees, and ants. Women probably discovered agriculture while gathering plants near dwellings. The transformation was gradual—first collecting wild grains, then noticing seeds sprouting along paths between collection sites and camps, and finally deliberately planting seeds. Agricultural techniques evolved from simply scattering seeds to using digging sticks to developing hoes and eventually plows.

Early humans created diverse tools by adapting materials from their environment—using plant matter for shafts, knives, bottles, cords and clothing; wood for sticks, clubs and handles; stones shaped into hammers, scrapers, arrowheads and axes; and animal parts for implements and containers.

> "The ingenuity of primitive men probably equaled—perhaps it surpassed—that of the average modern man; we differ from them through the social accumulation of knowledge, materials and tools, rather than through innate superiority of brains."

### The Development of Trade

Trade existed from very early in human history for the same reasons it exists today: because skills and resources were unevenly distributed across regions, leading groups to produce surpluses of items they could make efficiently and exchange them for needed goods they couldn't produce.

> "Certain American Indian villages were almost entirely devoted to making arrow-heads; some in New Guinea to making pottery; some in Africa to blacksmithing, or to making boats or lances. Such specializing tribes or villages sometimes acquired the names of their industry (Smith, Fisher, Potter...), and these names were in time attached to specializing families."

The mode of exchange evolved from gift-giving to barter and finally to money (though not directly to coinage).

> "There is hardly anything that has not been employed as money by some people at some time: beans, fish-hooks, shells, pearls, beads, cocoa seeds, tea, pepper, at last sheep, pigs, cows, and slaves."

Cattle were particularly useful as currency as they transported themselves and reproduced, providing "interest." Our modern economic terms reflect this history: "Our own words capital, chattel and cattle go back through the French to the Latin capitale, meaning property: and this in turn derives from caput, meaning head—i.e., of cattle."

### Communal Ownership

Pre-agricultural societies mostly practiced communal ownership and resource sharing.

> "Almost everywhere, among primitive peoples, land was owned by the community. The North American Indians, the natives of Peru, the Chittagong Hill tribes of India, the Borneans and South Sea Islanders seem to have owned and tilled the soil in common, and to have shared the fruits together."

> "When Turner told a Samoan about the poor in London the 'savage' asked in astonishment: 'How is it? No food? No friends? No house to live in? Where did he grow? Are there no houses belonging to his friends?'"

The emergence of agriculture fundamentally changed this arrangement.
### Agriculture: The First Cultural Revolution

> "The first form of culture is agriculture. It is when man settles down to till the soil and lay up provisions for the uncertain future that he finds time and reason to be civilized. Within that little circle of security—a reliable supply of water and food—he builds his huts, his temples and his schools..."

Agriculture represents one of the three fundamental steps that led humanity from primitive existence to civilization—speech, agriculture, and writing. The shift to agriculture created the foundation for higher pursuits, allowing humans to transcend basic biological imperatives and pursue cultural and intellectual development.

> "Slowly it became apparent that agriculture could provide a better and steadier food supply than hunting. With that realization man took one of the three steps that led from the beast to civilization—speech, agriculture, and writing."

#discuss This transition has parallels to our current technological revolution. Throughout history, humanity has continuously outsourced certain types of labor, from hunting to agriculture, from physical labor to industrial work, from industrial work to knowledge work. As artificial intelligence begins to automate knowledge work, we may find ourselves with more freedom from necessity, potentially enabling a new flowering of civilization.

The emergence of agriculture led to the concept of private property, which fundamentally restructured the framework of human civilization. This shift redefined the nature of societal institutions—from warfare and slavery to patriarchal structures, legal systems, religious practices, moral codes, and cultural traditions—all reconfigured around the notion of ownership and possession.

> "When agriculture became the settled life of men it soon appeared that the land was most fruitfully tilled when the rewards of careful husbandry accrued to the family that had provided it."

> "Communism brought a certain security to all who survived the diseases and accidents due to the poverty and ignorance of primitive society; but it did not lift them out of that poverty. Individualism brought wealth, but it brought, also, insecurity and slavery; it stimulated the latent powers of superior men, but it intensified the competition of life, and made men feel bitterly a poverty which, when all shared it alike, had seemed to oppress none."

## Social Organization and Stratification

### The Institution of Slavery

In purely hunting societies, slavery was unknown—the hunter's family handled menial work, and men alternated between intense hunting/warfare and periods of rest.

Agriculture created the conditions for slavery by establishing more settled communities and requiring regular, consistent labor rather than intermittent exertion. Initially, war captives were killed or eaten, but eventually victors realized "the only good prisoner is a live one" who could be put to work. Durant observes:

> "It was a great moral improvement when men ceased to kill or eat their fellowmen, and merely made them slaves. A similar development on a larger scale may be seen today, when a nation victorious in war no longer exterminates the enemy, but enslaves it with indemnities."

Slavery played a pivotal role in human development: "Probably it was through centuries of slavery that our race acquired its traditions and habits of toil. No one would do any hard or persistent work if he could avoid it without physical, economic or social penalty. Slavery became part of the discipline by which man was prepared for industry." This system eventually became so normalized that even the greatest thinkers of antiquity like Aristotle and St. Paul accepted it.

The division of labor and inherent differences in human abilities led to social stratification. The author notes that "in the primitive group we find as a rule no distinction between slave and free, no serfdom, no caste, and little if any distinction between chief and followers." Yet as societies developed specialized roles and tools, "every invention was a new weapon in the hands of the strong, and further strengthened them in their mastery and use of the weak." The inheritance of advantages compounded these differences across generations.

> "Slowly the increasing complexity of tools and trades subjected the unskilled or weak to the skilled or strong; every invention was a new weapon in the hands of the strong, and further strengthened them in their mastery and use of the weak."

### War and the Formation of States

Conflict became common as groups competed for resources like hunting grounds, pastures, and fertile soil. States typically originated through conquest—specifically when more warlike tribes (often hunters and herders) conquered agricultural communities and established themselves as a ruling class.

Despite its violent beginnings, the state eventually serves the crucial function of maintaining internal peace and regulating the interrelations between different groups within a complex society. This evolution represents a development from dominance through force to dominance through law.

> "Every state begins in compulsion; but the habits of obedience become the content of conscience, and soon every citizen thrills with loyalty to the flag."

These economic and social changes ultimately necessitated the formation of the state as "an indispensable instrument for the regulation of classes, the protection of property, the waging of war, and the organization of peace."

## Gender Relations and Family Structure

### Women's Contributions to Civilization

Women developed agriculture, sewing, weaving, pottery, and other crucial crafts. They also helped domesticate animals and built the foundations of the home.

> "Most economic advances, in early society, were made by the woman rather than the man. While for centuries he clung to his ancient ways of hunting and herding, she developed agriculture near the camp, and those busy arts of the home which were to become the most important industries of later days."

However, as agriculture became more complex and cattle breeding emerged as a source of wealth, men took control of these economic spheres. The shift to plough agriculture, which required greater physical strength, further elevated male economic power.

### The Evolution of Marriage and Family

With increased property came men's demands for female fidelity to ensure inheritance by biological sons. This transition led to the replacement of mother-right with father-right and the establishment of the patriarchal family. Under this new system, women became property, first of their fathers, then of their husbands.

Marriage evolved from primitive sexual communism (where relationships were largely unrestricted) through various experimental forms including trial marriage, group marriage, and polygamy, before reaching the more recent development of monogamy in many societies.

Marriage was primarily an economic partnership where women provided labor and children (additional workers). Property ownership played a crucial role in this evolution—individual marriage emerged largely because men wanted to ensure their property would pass to their biological children.

> "In all these forms and varieties of marriage there is hardly a trace of romantic love... In simple days men married for cheap labor, profitable parentage, and regular meals."

Polygamy (specifically polygyny, where one man has multiple wives) was widespread in primitive societies due to several factors: higher male mortality rates creating an excess of women, men's desire for variety, women's interest in sharing domestic burdens, and the economic value of having many children. It also had eugenic advantages, as the most capable men fathered more children.

Sexual morality developed alongside marriage institutions. Premarital chastity and virginity became valued only with the rise of property and patriarchal systems.

## Religion, Morality, and Social Order

### The Origins and Functions of Religion

Fear—particularly fear of death—was "the first mother of the gods." Wonder at natural phenomena, the mystery of dreams (especially seeing the dead in dreams), and the enigma of sex and fertility also contributed to religious development.

> "Religion supports morality by two means chiefly: myth and tabu. Myth creates the supernatural creed through which celestial sanctions may be given to forms of conduct socially (or sacerdotally) desirable; heavenly hopes and terrors inspire the individual to put up with restraints placed upon him by his masters and his group. Man is not naturally obedient, gentle, or chaste; and next to that ancient compulsion which finally generates conscience, nothing so quietly and continuously conduces to these uncongenial virtues as the fear of the gods."

Religion evolved through worship of celestial objects (sun, moon, stars), earth and fertility deities, sexual symbols, animals (totemism), and eventually idealized dead humans (ancestor worship).

The moral function of religion was to support social order through myths (providing supernatural sanctions for desired behaviors) and taboos (religious prohibitions). Religion helped maintain institutions like property and marriage by giving them divine authority.

However, religion tends to lag behind social changes, often defending outdated moral codes against new economic and social realities. There's always a tension between religion and advancing knowledge. As societies develop, religious institutions that once unified culture begin to clash with new discoveries and social changes. This leads to secularization—the transfer of functions like education, law, and marriage from religious to secular control. Eventually, a society and its religion may fall together, while new myths arise among the oppressed to build another civilization.

### The Role and Relativity of Morality

Moral systems serve crucial social functions regardless of their specific content. They enable social cooperation by restraining individual impulses that would otherwise lead to chaos. The specific rules matter less than the unanimity with which they are followed, as this creates predictability and order. Durant compares morality to the rules of a game—the particular rules may be arbitrary, but without some rules, no game is possible.

> "We must not conclude that morals are worthless because they differ according to time and place, and that it would be wise to show our historic learning by at once discarding the moral customs of our group. A little anthropology is a dangerous thing. It is substantially true that—as Anatole France ironically expressed the matter—'morality is the sum of the prejudices of a community'; and that, as Anacharsis put it among the Greeks, if one were to bring together all customs considered sacred by some group, and were then to take away all customs considered immoral by some group, nothing would remain. But this does not prove the worthlessness of morals; it only shows in what varied ways social order has been preserved."

> "Our heroic rejection of the customs and morals of our tribe, upon our adolescent discovery of their relativity, betrays the immaturity of our minds; given another decade and we begin to understand that there may be more wisdom in the moral code of the group—the formulated experience of generations of the race—than can be explained in a college course. Sooner or later the disturbing realization comes to us that even that which we cannot understand may be true."

> "The institutions, conventions, customs and laws that make up the complex structure of a society are the work of a hundred centuries and a billion minds; and one mind must not expect to comprehend them in one lifetime, much less in twenty years. We are warranted in concluding that morals are relative, and indispensable."

## Knowledge, Language, and Education

### The Revolutionary Development of Abstract Language

Before language with abstract terms, thought was limited to individual objects or experiences remembered through sensory perception. The revolutionary development was the creation of common nouns—words that could represent entire classes of objects rather than just specific instances. This allowed humans to think abstractly about categories, qualities separate from objects, and concepts that couldn't be directly observed. The author describes this as "the beginning of humanity."

> "The beginning of humanity came when some freak or crank, half animal and half man, squatted in a cave or in a tree, cracking his brain to invent the first common noun, the first sound-sign that would signify a group of like objects: house that would mean all houses, man that would mean all men, light that would mean every light that ever shone on land or sea. From that moment the mental development of the race opened upon a new and endless road. For words are to thought what tools are to work; the product depends largely on the growth of the tools."

Many tribes had specific names for individual types of objects (like different kinds of trees) but no general term for the category itself (like "tree"). Abstract concepts such as tone, space, spirit, and consciousness were largely absent. These abstract terms developed alongside thought in a reciprocal relationship, becoming "the tools of subtlety and the symbols of civilization."

### Education and Knowledge Transmission

Education in primitive societies focused primarily on practical skills and character development rather than abstract knowledge. It was a direct apprenticeship relationship where children learned the essential skills for survival from their elders. This practical education led to rapid development—in some tribes, boys of ten had already mastered nearly all their fathers' skills and were ready for independent life. However, this early maturity often led to early stagnation, with individuals becoming "adult at twelve and old at twenty-five."

> "The primitive father put his trust in character, as modern education has put its trust in intellect; he was concerned to make not scholars but men. Hence the initiation rites which, among nature peoples, ordinarily marked the arrival of the youth at maturity and membership in the tribe, were designed to test courage rather than knowledge; their function was to prepare the young for the hardships of war and the responsibilities of marriage, while at the same time they indulged the old in the delights of inflicting pain."

A crucial aspect of primitive education was the initiation rite, which marked the transition to adulthood and tribal membership. These ceremonies tested courage and endurance rather than knowledge, preparing youth for the hardships of war and marriage. These tests were often brutal and sometimes fatal, with practices like circumcision, physical ordeals, and various forms of bodily mutilation. These rites served as a form of natural selection and a way to ensure that only the strongest individuals would reproduce.

### The Evolution of Writing and Intellectual Tools

Writing played little role in primitive education. Instead, oral tradition and memorization were the primary methods of cultural transmission. The invention of writing may have initially been met with opposition, like every new invention.

> "An Egyptian legend relates that when the god Thoth revealed his discovery of the art of writing to King Thamos, the good King denounced it as an enemy of civilization. 'Children and young people,' protested the monarch, 'who had hitherto been forced to apply themselves diligently to learn and retain whatever was taught them, would cease to apply themselves, and would neglect to exercise their memories.'"

Writing evolved from pictorial representations to abstract symbols, beginning as practical marks for trade and commerce before developing into more complex systems. Early writing systems were essentially drawings—pictographs that represented objects directly. Every word and letter known to us began as a picture, similar to how trade-marks and zodiac signs function today.

### Early Science and Mathematics

Primitive science emerged from practical needs rather than theoretical curiosity. Science may have begun with agriculture—geometry (literally "earth measurement") developed from the need to measure land, while astronomy arose from the necessity to track seasons for planting and harvesting. Navigation advanced astronomical knowledge, trade developed mathematics, and industrial arts laid the foundations for physics and chemistry.

Early counting systems were remarkably simple in many tribes. Some counted only to two or three before using terms like "many" or "innumerable." Counting was done primarily with fingers, leading to the decimal system, while body parts served as standards of measurement—hands for spans, thumbs for inches, feet for feet. The duodecimal system (base-12) emerged because twelve is easily divisible by many smaller numbers, leading to its use in measurements that persist today (12 months, 12 inches in a foot, etc.).

Astronomy began with the measurement of time by celestial bodies, with lunar calendars preceding solar ones. However, practical astronomy was often overshadowed by astrology—the attempt to predict human affairs through celestial movements.

Medicine developed as a mixture of practical knowledge and spiritual beliefs. Disease was conceived as possession by alien spirits, similar in concept to the modern germ theory. Healing combined magical incantations with practical remedies, particularly herbal treatments discovered primarily by women. Primitive surgery was surprisingly advanced, with successful procedures including trephination (skull surgery), setting fractures, and using various anesthetics derived from plants.

## The Achievements of "Primitive" Societies

Despite lacking writing and formal state structures, primitive peoples developed virtually every other element necessary for civilized life. They created all the basic modes of economic subsistence: hunting, fishing, herding, agriculture, transportation, construction, industry, commerce, and finance. They established fundamental political structures like the clan, family, village community, and tribe, finding ways to balance freedom and order. They developed moral systems that regulated child-rearing, sexual relations, and social conduct. They created religious frameworks that reinforced moral codes and strengthened group cohesion.

Beyond these practical achievements, primitive peoples developed complex languages, medical practices, scientific knowledge, and artistic expressions. Their innovations in art spanned from body decoration to architecture, from dance to drama.

## The Fragility and Transmission of Civilization

> "For civilization is not something inborn or imperishable; it must be acquired anew by every generation, and any serious interruption in its financing or its transmission may bring it to an end. Man differs from the beast only by education, which may be defined as the technique of transmitting civilization."

This transmission is incredibly fragile and requires constant maintenance. Any significant interruption in the process—whether through social upheaval, economic collapse, or institutional failure—can lead to the loss of crucial cultural knowledge and skills. This makes education not just one aspect of civilization but the very mechanism of its survival.

The process of cultural transmission must be both vertical (between generations) and horizontal (across social groups). It requires not just the passing of information but the cultivation of values, skills, and understanding that make civilization possible.

> "Sometimes the sources of the wealth that financed it are exhausted or diverted; sometimes a change in trade routes leaves its cities to decay; sometimes the concentration of wealth into a few hands leaves the rest in such poverty that they lose the economic and cultural stimulus to effort and achievement."
